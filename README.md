# Manipulating-Light-Trace-
This project is about how light rays change direction continuously to become a curved trace under a special medium called Gradient Refractive Index Medium (often called Gradient Box or GRIN Medium). 
The purpose of this project is to use MATLAB to visualize how it happens in GRIN medium which are made accordingly. Like if one wants to manipulate the light trace, and wanna give  it any conical shapes like circular, parabolic or hyperbolic or any other shapes. Then one must use the Fermat's principle, which will help one generate the required position dependent refractive index according to the needed trace. 
And to study how Mirage effect takes place.
The MATLAB codes for each trace manipulation and the whole document of study have been provided.
